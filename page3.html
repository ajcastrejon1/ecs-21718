     <h2> Intro</h2>
     <p> Two of my Favorite things are food and music. Food takes you on a trip of flavor. Music can transport you to another world. There is so much food and music in this world with so many different variations  from different cultures and backgrounds. These are two of my most favorite things in this world.
     </p>

     <h2>Posole</h2>
     <p> This was my first love. ever sice I can remember this had been my most favourite food. Posole is a soup with maize and chicken or pork. You can addd so many things to it like chile, onion, avocado, lime, oregano and so much more. Posole is different for many people because they have their own special added ingriedients and more. Posole for me is something we have every ounce in a while, but when I have I really enjoy it. My grandmother's posole is rather simple but its the best. Posole is the best homemade food.

     <h2>Wings</h2>
     <p> Wings are the best food and my true love. Wings are just the best food to snack on. They are the best food at Super bowl parties or any parties for that matter. Wings just tatse really good and come in a bunch of varieties. I get my wings from Wingstop. Wings are the best food.

     <h2>Tyler The Creator and XXXTentacion</h2>
     <p> Tyler and tenatacion's  rap is fun. There is a lot of profanity and offensive stuff in their music but if you can get past that they're pretty funny, in my opinion. There are some more serious songs of theirs in which they tell us about their problems/internal struggles which I find facinating. I feel that sometimes I can step in their shoes and that the song is about me which is pretty cool that their music can do that. I really enjoy their music.

         <h2>Lofi and Studio Ghibli</h2>
         <p>On their own they are both great. Lofi has this chill/cool vibe that I use while doing homework or cleaning. Studio Ghibli's soundtracks from their movies just take me to other worlds and I love that feeling. On a warm breezy Summers day I love listeing to the Spirited away soundtrack on the roof of my garage. Its just so great that I cant really express it well. Okay like I said earlier they're both great on their own but when put together its just ... I cant explain the level of happiness it brings me. The chill vibes of Lofi combined with the other worldly music of Ghibli films, its just ... too good. All I can say is that I love these two things so much.  </p>

     <h2>Piano</h2>
     <p> Piano is great! I can paly all the music I love on Piano and some of the Music I love is played on Piano. I have always liked piano and nearly 2 years ago was when I got my first one. Its so cool to play paino covers of my favourite Music. I can play Jocelyn Flores from XXXTentacion and One Summer's Day from Spirited away and much more. Piano is just such a cool instrument to me because you can play so much music on it from classical to modern. Piano is so cool because I can play some songs that would regularly take for tahn one instrument to paly it. Piano is great!
